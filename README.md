# Quiz Master Application

## Purpose

The Quiz Master was attemped as an extension following from building a rudimentary banking application. I intend to clarify my understanding of object method calls, inheritance and best practices for structuring and approaching an application. 

## MVP Features
* User can choose an Easy or Hard version of a quiz
* Each time a quiz is created, it is populated with questions and a correct answer
* A separate class `input_quiz.rb` will handle and sterilise user input
* `Quiz.rb` will initiate an array of question objects, in turn created in`Question.rb`
